### <a name="technical_questions"></a> Technical Questions 

#### Project Ideas

##### [U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi-e50c9)
- [Initial Investigation](https://github.com/TimothyHelton/k2datascience/blob/master/notebooks/US_Chronic_Disease_Indicators.ipynb)
- Most promising attribute of this dataset would be exploring illnesses based 
on geographical location.
- **Probably not a project topic**

##### Pull Historical Medical Device Data
- Track medical device companies web pages from history and look at what they
promised over time.
    - Identify medical device companies
    - Mask IP to avail getting blacklisted
    - Try to get into thousands of companies
    - Look at crunch base 
- [Big Query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery)
- [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api)
- [FDA Recalls](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ListofRecalls/default.htm)
- [Way Back Machine Medical Devices](http://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170110233525/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Databases/default.htm)
- [US National Library of Medicine](https://accessgudid.nlm.nih.gov/)

##### What are ideal places to settle down and plant roots?
- Begin with a job search based on occupation for each state.
- scrape indeed.com **Large amounts of data are available on this site**
    - Job Postings
    - Company Reviews
    - Salary Information
    - Individuals Resumes
- Search for a second occupation (significant other) for each state.
- Create an interactive map of the United States colored by available jobs 
that may be filtered for the first occupation, the second occupation or both.
- Use time series data of job postings to forecast if states are on the rise
or decline for the occupations of interest.
    - Was hoping to use the [Way Back Machine](https://web.archive.org/), but
    indeed.com does not allow archiving.
- Chose a subset of states to pursue further.
- Identify potential cities
- Evaluate home prices in perspective cities.
    - scrape Zillow
        - basic search criteria
- Evaluate school districts
    - [School Digger](https://www.schooldigger.com/)
    - [Great Schools](http://www.greatschools.org/)
- **Most of these ideas are just gathering data.  What are ways to add 
"Data Science" into this project?**
