### <a name="technical_questions"></a> Technical Questions 

#### Project Ideas
- Investigated Dataset:
    - [U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi-e50c9)
    - [Initial Investigation](https://github.com/TimothyHelton/k2datascience/blob/master/notebooks/US_Chronic_Disease_Indicators.ipynb)
    - Most promising attribute of this dataset would be exploring illnesses 
    based on geographical location.
    - Probably not a project topic.

TODO
- Pull Historical Data to create a unique dataset
    - Track medical device companies web pages from history and look at what
     they promised over time.
        - Identify medical device companies
        - Mask IP to avail getting blacklisted
        - Try to get into thousands of companies
        - Look at crunch base 
    - [Big Query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery)
    - [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api)
- [FDA Recalls](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ListofRecalls/default.htm)
- [Way Back Machine Medical Devices](http://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170110233525/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Databases/default.htm)
- [US National Library of Medicine](https://accessgudid.nlm.nih.gov/)

TODO go through the question epicycle for this idea 
- What qualities result in high employee retention?
    - Scrap LinkedIn, Indeed, GlassDoor, Twitter and Facebook
    - Build dataset
    - Explore traits that result in "employee happiness"
    - After setting grading criteria apply the metric to data science 
    focused companies
    - If interested in any of the "good" companies send the study to data 
    science contact
