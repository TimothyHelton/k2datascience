### <a name="ds_conversation"></a> Data Science Conversation (10 minutes)
- [Simple Time Series Forecasting Models to Test So That You Don't Fool Yourself](http://machinelearningmastery.com/simple-time-series-forecasting-models/)
    - [Notebook Calculations](../notebooks/Time_Series_Forcasting.ipynb)
    - Persistence Model ("Naive" Forecast)
        - Additional Article On Persistence Model
            - [How to Make Baseline Predictions for Time Series Forecasting with Python](http://machinelearningmastery.com/persistence-time-series-forecasting-with-python/)
        - **GOALS**
            - Establish baseline performance on forecast method as quickly 
            as possible.
            - Gain understanding of the dataset to develop a more advanced 
            model.
        - Test Harness
            - **Dataset**: use to train and evaluate models
            - **Resampling Technique**: test / train split
                - Simple
                - Fast
                - Repeatable
            - **Performance Measure**: evaluation method
        - Explicit time solution algorithm
        - Implementation
            1. Transform the univariate dataset into a supervised learning 
            problem.
            1. Establish the train and test datasets for the test harness.
            1. Define the persistence model.
            1. Make a forecast and establish a baseline performance.
            1. Review the complete example and plot the output.
    - Expanding Window Model
        - Discuss in mentor session 04
    - Rolling Window Forecast Model
        - Discuss in mentor session 05

### <a name="technical_questions"></a> Technical Questions 
- Project Ideas:
    - [DATA.GOV](https://www.data.gov/)
        - Looks like this site has datasets, so web scrapping would not be 
        required.  Think it would be better to mine our own data, but a 
        topic from this site may be considered as a fall back option.
        - [U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi-e50c9)
