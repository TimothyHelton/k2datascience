### <a name="technical_questions"></a> Technical Questions 
- Project #2
    - [NBA Players stats since 1950 Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats)
- **Investigation Question**
    - Is it possible to predict which NBA players will have a Hall of Fame 
    career only based on their first, second or third years statistics in the league?

1. Scrape web for names of all Hall of Fame players
2. Split Hall of Fame players into a training / test set.
3. Standardize stats to current year of investigation and older.
    1. For example comparing heights of players today to 1950 does not make
    sense.  If this was not done all players today would be biased towards
    making it into the Hall of Fame.
4. PCA
    1. Principle Components Analysis
    2. Use to filter classification characteristics
5. ICA
    1. Independent Components Analysis
    2. Use to filter classification characteristics
6. Hall of Fame Graphics
    1. Height
    2. Weight
    3. Wing Span
    4. Ratio Wing Span : Height
    5. Championships
    6. Total Wins
    7. Number of teammates in the Hall of Fame
7. Logistic Regression
8. Linear Discriminant Analysis
9. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
10. K Nearest Neighbors
11. Deep Learning?
