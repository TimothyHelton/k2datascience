### <a name="technical_questions"></a> Technical Questions 
- Project #2
    - [NBA Players stats since 1950 Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats)
- Investigation Question
    - Is it possible to predict which NBA players will have a Hall of Fame 
    career only based on their first, second or third years statistics in the league?

1. Scrape web for names of all Hall of Fame players
2. Split Hall of Fame players into a training / test set.
3. Standardize stats to current year of investigation and older.
    1. For example comparing heights of players today to 1950 doesnâ€™t make sense.  If this was not done all players today would be biased towards making it into the Hall of Fame.
4. PCA
    1. Principle Components Analysis
    2. Use to filter down features
5. ICA
    1. Independent Components Analysis
    2. Use to filter down features
6. Hall of Fame Graphics
    1. Height
    2. Weight
    3. Wing Span
    4. Ratio Wing Span : Height
