### <a name="ds_conversation"></a> Data Science Conversation (10 minutes)
I would like to get a recommendation of an article or blog post related to 
data science that you are already familiar with each week.
Reports from your personal work may be great candidates.
I'll study the article and then the following week we'll discuss it for no
more than ten minutes.
The idea here is to hold the equivalent of a "code review" only focused on
data science in lieu of programming.

Purpose:
- Become comfortable discussing data science topics.
- Learn from what you found interesting about the article.
    - Did the researchers primary questions set them up for success?
    - What other techniques could have been applied to improve the report?
