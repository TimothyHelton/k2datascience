### <a name="notes"></a> Notes
- Agendas will be created for each week so stay on track.

#### Python Interpreter
- Anaconda will be used for the course
- My k2datascience repository is set up as a python package
    - to install the package to the active interpreter do the following.
        1. clone or fork the repository
        1. navigate to the k2datascience directory
        1. activate the virtual environment to install the package
        1. enter the following command
```
pip install -e .
```

- While in an interpreter or notebook if changes are made to the source code
 the package must be reloaded.

```python
import k2datascience

# make change to the source code

from imp import reload
reload(k2datascience)

# the changed source code is not active in the interpreter
```

#### Future Mentor Session Ideas
- Mock interview
    - May be helpful to do this soon to set a baseline, and then repeat 
    toward the end of the program.
- Learn to "Speak Data Science"
    - Evaluate confidence level of discussing data science topics.
    - May need to read additional articles to gain this skill
- Chose a unique topic to explore.
    - Develop data set
    - Web Scraping
    - Machine Learning
    - AI
